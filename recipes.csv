Lemon drizzle cake,"It's difficult not to demolish this classic by Tana Ramsay in just one sitting, so why not make two at once?Recipe TipJoin our expert Masterclass! Interested in doing BBC Good Food online cooking classes?  Come and learn from our team in our online classrooms.  You can start today. Yummy & easy to makeThis one of the easiest and tastiest cakes to make! I half all quantities and it makes a smaller loaf which is just right for the two of us.Delicious and so easy to make.Amazing recipe! Tried it the first time today and I think it's one of the best cakes I've ever made. Would recommend to anyone!! So light and moist. A huge success with everyone in my house!!Made this for the first time today and it turned out brilliant!
I used 4 medium size eggs as wasn't sure of the size. Really nice light sponge. Definitely will be baking this again!Very tasty cake, it didn't specify what sized eggs to use however, so I used 4 large eggs. It tastes lovely, but I think if I was to try it again, I'd use 3 large eggs instead.Exceptional cake, I read the comments before baking and added the zest of 2 lemons plus juice of 1/2 a lemon to the batter. I divided the batter between 2 tins and cooked at 160 degrees for 50 minutes. Perfect result, beautifully raised cakes, cooked all through and a very light sponge that tasted like lemon Madeira cake. For the drizzle I used juice of 2 1/2 lemons with the amount of sugar stated in the recipe and poured half over each sponge as soon as they came out of the oven. It wasn't overly sweet. I let the sugar dissolve in the lemon juice whilst the cakes baked, I didn't have a crunchy topping but I'm not keen on icing so it was perfect for me. I'll definitely make again.Wow! So delicious! The cooking time is a bit fiddly though.I always use this recipe and it comes out lovely, made it this morning for friends. I ended up changing bits as there is a lot of batter. I do use two (2lb) loaf tins rather than one, and get two decent sized loaf cakes. With the glaze, I use two lemons and 140g of caster sugar, and it covers both really well. Also, I add the juice of one lemon in the mix and the zest of two lemons , as I like it quite lemony and it makes it less sweeter too. Plus add a teaspoon of baking powder, even though it uses self raising flour.I tried this for the first time today and I’m sad to say I’m very disappointed. When mixing together I did notice there was a lot of batter but didn’t think anything about it. I checked on it 25 mins into the time and a lot of the batter was now on the bottom of the oven!! So much of the batter was still in the tin so I wasn’t too fussed but I thought it would then be hard to try and put the icing on top when it was done. After the allocated time I took it out to check if it was done but it was still so runny even though it was really golden. I put it in for more time and it was okay. I would ideally put it in 2 tins and have two smaller cakes or use a different recipe all together.I am wanting to make this gluten free, do I just swap the flour to GF flour? Is there a need for xanthan? ThanksCan I freeze this?Hi,
Yes you can.
LuluI made this recipe and the cake came out great. But the drizzle didn’t look like the one in the picture.. was wondering whether it should be icing sugar used for the drizzle rather than caster sugar? The one in the picture looks like it has an icing glaze on it but mine doesn’t!Hi Chloe,
The drizzle should get whiter and more opaque as it dries and sets. It's possible that your lemons were very juicy and the icing you made was less sugary. You could add a little icing sugar as well next time you make the cake, you need the caster sugar for a bit of crunch though.
I hope this help,
LuluHi, my cake cracked along the top, do you know why?Hi,
Your oven might be running a bit hot, do you have an oven thermometer you can test it with? Does this happen with other cakes?
LuluHello , I am new to baking so a bit confused on the drizzle bit- does the cake have to be completely cool when you put the drizzle on and do you keep it in the tin when you do so ? Thank you :)Hi can you swap lemons for lemon juice? If so do you know what measurement please, with present times just trying to use ingredients I have, thankyou.Hi, Esther from the food team here! If you mean long life lemon juice then yes! Id recommend using 2 tbsp in the icing but just leave out the zest from the cake don't try replacing it with juice. Thanks for your question!This is similar to a pound cake recipe. And in the way you can add 3 tablespoons of milk and some extra lemon juice to a pound cake, I did exactly that with this cake.
I used self raising flour but since moving to France, the self raising flour has less raising agents so I gave it a boost with an extra half teaspoon of baking powder.
I used a 9x21 loaf tin in silicon and had to cover with foil toward the end to ensure the last part baked properly.Yes, you can make it fit in one piece of paper.Just a tip for people reading comments about overflowing and it being too eggy. You need a 2lb loaf tin and I once made the mistake of using plain flour and that is why it tastes eggy!! Made it with self raising numerous times and it is amazing!!!the recommended tin size is WAY too small. half the dough oozed out. either use larger tin, or half the measurements, or bake in 2 tinsFollowing some of the comments I read (I am not a Baker at all) I used close to 3 large eggs, (I can't stand eggy cakes!) a tsp of vanilla extract and the juice of one lemon which I added to the mixture. I also used stork instead of unsalted butter.
Instead of a large cake the mixture fitted 12 muffin cases perfectly, which is great for the kids! They loved them.!I used 3 medium eggs, 2 tablespoons of milk, zest of 2 lemons and the juice of half a lemon (which is ideal when you need the juice of 1.5 lemons for the drizzle). The cake is deliciously moist and lemony.I had to tweak a few things to make this work:
- use a 30cm x 9cm x 9cm Loaf pan (Kaiser does a good one)
- reduce to 3 medium eggs
- add zest of 2 lemons instead of 1
- add 2 capfuls of vanilla extract for a richer taste
Also cook time might be slightly longer but not by much.Needs a bit more lemon flavorThis is a great tasting recipe and not too dry but I did find that it was only cooking on the outside and not in the inside so I had to cover it in tin foil and put it in for another 10 minutes.
I also added in 2 lemon zest and 1 juice instead of just 1 zest because I felt as though there wouldn’t of been enough lemon flavour.As others have mentioned, use 3 eggs and a longer cooking time. Otherwise great. I topped mine with a lemon cream cheese icing.",60,Easy,false

It got gobbled up on the same day, people just kept going back for me. I'm so impressed!! I used 70% chocolate as its all I could find. My cake tin was a bit wider than the one recommended so only cut it in half and cooled the cake in the fridge and made sure the ganache was cool enough before spreading over the cake. So good!If you love chocolate, you’ll love this! Scrumptious- rich and gooey and very calorific treat! Keeps well for a few days and if it lasts long enough to go a little dry, then simply warm in a microwave for a few seconds and serve with some vanilla ice cream.Wow. This cake is phenomenal. It magically combines all of the best bits of a brownie and a cake - it is rich, fudgy, moist and dense while also standing impressively tall! Hands down the best chocolate cake I have ever made, I can't wait to make it again! I totally stand by the incredible amount of other 5* reviews on here!This is the most delicious thing I have ever made. Didn't have enough butter so used some coconut oil to make the weight up, lemon juice in milk substituted for buttermilk and used a tin of condensed milk, best cooking chocolate (lime green wrapper) and vanilla extract for the icing. Worked a treat, sealed over cracked top (couldn't wait to get it out of tin), smoothed out beautifully, stayed exactly where it was put and tasted (surprisingly) subtle and delicious. Made the cake in advance and it got more moist and more delicious for as long as it lasted! Thank you so much.Oh yes. I made this cake for the first time today. I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting the Muscavado sugar with light brown soft sugar as I couldn’t find any. I used Lindt 70% Cocoa dark chocolate. Also, I baked it in two 20cm diameter sandwich tins, each 3cm deep for 50 minutes (lightly greased, disc of non-stick baking paper on base, greased and dusted tin with a little flour). The cake was light, the outside slightly crispy and the ganache was fudgey - absolutely delicious. Perfect warmed for a few seconds and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 10/10.It was okay but very dense. Also the chocolate ganache needs a lot more chocolate if you want it to harden a bit.Perfect. Thank youBaked this for my MILs birthday, very pleased with the end result and it went down very well! My Husband had baked this for my birthday a few years ago, and both me and my MIL loved it then, so it was a no brainer. Not sure why there are a few negative reviews myself - Maybe some people don’t like really moist cake or maybe a baker error?! Followed the sponge recipe pretty much to the letter, one 20cm tin worked well, just had to leave in oven a bit longer. Cooled for a few hours before removing from tin. Cut in half (yes you have to be careful, but it does get covered with ganache if not) & made the ganache the next day. Reduced the cream in that, so wasn’t so runny and didn’t add the extra sugar. Looked and tasted fantastic if I do say so myself ;)I made this cake for my own birthday. I followed the recipe exactly however I did make it in two tins. What can I say they were incredible the sponge was light and delicious. It melted in the mouth and had a beautiful combination of flavours as I made a vanilla butter cream for the middle between the two layers as I felt that a dark chocolate ganache would be too much on its own. I was also worried that the dark chocolate in the ganache would be too strong but I couldn’t have been more wrong. Overall best recipe because I usually don’t even like cake. Win winMore of a brownie than a traditional cake. I split it into three tins in order to reduce cooking time, not sure what impact that would have on the cake texture but they came out almost with a hard sugar shell. I also put around 170g of sugar instead of the 200g as that seemed way too much. Used entirely self-raising and added some baking powder in an attempt to make a fluffier texture. Wouldn't make again but then again I did switch around the recipe a lot.I’ve moved to the US and can only find all purpose flour for this recipe (no self raising). Is this going to affect the cake?Hi,
Hi,
We haven't tested this car like this, but you can swap in the all purpose flour. You'll need to add a little more bicarbonate of soda, another 1/4 tsp should be ok (you must use the buttermilk to make this work) or add 1/2 tsp baking powder to make sure the cake rises. I hope this helps.
LuluHello, I'd like to make this cake in a 8"" X 12"" tin. I have worked out the surface area of the tin and it's roughly double the 20cm tin. If I double the ingredients do I need to adjust the temperature or baking time?Hi,
The cooking time depends on the size and depth of the cake rather than how much mixture there is, if the mixture in the tin isn't too deep then the cooking time shouldn't be much longer as it will cook from the top down and bottom up as well as in from the sides.
I hope this helps,
LuluCan we use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate ?
We’re making it for a child and his mum and dad, so don’t think he’d like dark ?Hi, We haven't tested this with milk chocolate, if you use it in the cake it will have an impact on the flavour as milk chocolate doesn't give such a good flavour. Most cakes are made with dark chocolate for this reason, but if you want to change it then try using 100g of each. I've posted a recipe for a less intense dark chocolate cake below. For the icing, why not use this instead, it's much lighter.

LuluHi all, I am planning on making this cake for my brothers birthday next week but I only have two 8"" cake tins.
I've never really baked anything before so any advice on how this could be done would be greatly appreciated i.e. cooking times and temperature??
Thank you in advance :)I always make in 3 8"" tins, cook 30-35 mins. There will be to much mixture for 2 tins. It's easier to bake in seperate tins because its impossible to slice if baked whole.Hi Odhran,
You could make this in two tins but as we haven't tested it I'm afraid that I can't be sure of the cooking time, it will be shorter. If you haven't really baked before you might want to use a recipe that will fit your tins and give you a better chance at a good outcome. This one is really good and we use it quite often https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/easy-chocolate-cake
I hope this helps,
LuluLooks good but why use cocoa power when you are using the solid chocolate? I think that chocolate is a better and purer ingredient.I've baked this cake lots of times it never fails. Top Tip:- bake in 3 7"" sandwich tins 30-35 mins. It is impossible to slice baked as a whole cake, it's very light.Super fudgey moist cake, utterly decadent, you can only eat a small slice but its delicious. Tip: Definitely ensure it cools before assembling. Also its so moist that it doesn't even need any sugar syrup before assembling. Will definitely make again.This cake comes out a little dense. However, with the few alterations I made it came out really yummy and tasty especially for chocolate lovers!
1.) I cooked it about 160 degrees fan for 60 minutes no way near the 1h30 minutes. Thankfully I checked on it within 60 minutes otherwise the cake would have been very dry or burnt!
2.) Cover the top with baking paper or foil to stop the top burning.
3.) I used two sandwich tins instead of trying to cut the cake horizontally into 3. After reading the comments about how crumbly the cake comes out when you try to cut it horizontally, I would recommend doing this too or just using the ganache over the entire cake as this equally comes out very rich and chocolatey.
Hope that helps :)But it says 140 deg fan, for 1hr30mins. If you cook at 160, it'll come out drier on the outside as it's cooking too fast.My top tip is to make sure you use a loose-bottom or a spring form TALL cake tin, otherwise you might have issues with the cake crumbling when you try to remove it from a solid tin.Amazing every time!!
I recommend baking this in sandwich tins, when you don't need to slice it, just stack up and enjoy! Also, sandwich tins bake in half an hour or so (do check with a pin) so it's both quicker and easier.
Also, I use milk choc in ganache, as most of our family prefer milk chocolate.Don't add the sugar with milk chocolate, as it is only needed to reduce bitterness of dark chocolate.Hiya have you ever cooked this in 6 inch sandwich tins to make a taller cake? XxWhat a deliciously morish cake! Amazing is not enough to describe it...
The coffee cuts the extreme sweetness but you can barely notice the flavour.
I was told by someone it was quite heavy and brownie like (which i totally loved about it!) so made it lighter by using only self raising flour, with spectacular results
Tip1: use decaf cofee for a kid friendly version
Tip2: replace the plain flour for self raising for a fluffier texture, works really well
Tip3: its easier to cut the following day from bakingAmazing proper chocolate cake but here's 4 tips to help you make it even better and easier:
1) Use a bain-marie (i.e. a bowl over a pan of softly boiling water) to melt the chocolate and butter together. This prevents the chocolate from spoiling or splitting. Do the same when making the ganache.
2) Don't mix the coffee and water into the chocolate and butter. Oil and water don't mix well and are likely to split. Just add the coffee and water mixture later when you bind all the ingredients together.
3) Use 160g of each sugar. 200g is too much.
4) Leave the ganache to cool then whip with a whisk it to firm it up. It will then spread and hold beautifully.
Enjoy the cake!Consider less sugar as way too sugary",130,Easy,false
Best ever chocolate brownies recipe,"A foolproof brownie recipe for a squidgy chocolate bake. Watch our recipe video to help you get a perfect traybake every time.Recipe TipNot quite what you're looking for?Try our lower fat option, Ultimate makeover: Chocolate brownies, or other popular brownie recipes, Fudgy coconut brownies or Marbled brownies.This recipe was so easy to make however i had to bake it in the oven for an hour because it was crispy from the top but not cooked from the inside. However when i had finished it, it tasted deliciousI’ve been looking for a brownie recipe for years and now I’ve found it!!! These are totally delicious- I bake it for 25-30 mins max for a squidgy brownie. I put the first lot in for the full 35 mins the first time and found the perimeter squares were a bit dry!35 minutes not 25 and leave to cool completely before you refrigerate for a good few hours or overnight and you will (in my humble opinion) have the best squidgy brownies ever. 3nd time I’ve done em and they don’t stay around very longThese are fantastic! Rich, indulgent and not like your traditional brownies. I would recommend letting them cool and leaving in the fridge over night, this makes them dense, smooth and squidgy. Also make sure you do use THE BEST dark chocolate, it really elevates this recipe. Like most people on these comments, I cooked for 35 minutes, but I followed all the other measurements and steps to the T.These really are the best brownies! Easy to make if you follow the recipe carefully. Do watch the video for the tip about making the brownie 'handles' out of silver foil - it makes them very easy to get out of the tin once they're cold. I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I like the sound of someone's suggestion below to use an orange-flavoured plain chocolate for 50g of the chunks - might try that next time. I did cook for the extra 5 minutes that the recipe suggested, PLUS an extra 5 minutes after that, and they came out perfectly with the correct consistency of brownie fudgy-ness. You do need to let them cool in the tin completely, as it says, so that they 'set' enough to cut up. I left them as 16 square pieces, and didn't cut them further into triangles - too small and fiddly!I thought it would be good because of the high ratings it has received, but was very disappointed with this recipe. The method recommended in the recipe is to whisk the eggs and sugar until it’s a light mousse. The result of all this whisking is that the Brownies didn’t taste like proper brownies. They were more like a sort of failed sponge cake. In my opinion (and all my family and our guests’ opinion too), brownies should be a bit dense and squidgy.
I would recommend the chocolate and raspberry brownies recipe on this site. They turned out like proper brownies should.These are the most delicious brownies ever! My family are obsessed with these and everyone loves them. I occasionally use a round tin (20cm I think). Definitely try these out :)Tried this recipe and it's the BEST Brownie yet. Chocolatey, Chewy & not too sweet indulgence . It took 10 minutes extra time.Please make these. Your family, your friend, your partner, your kids, whoever is in your life will thank you. I used v cheap chocolate with the butter and it was v liquidy so I thought it was a lost cause especially when the brownie didn't cook, even after an extra 20 min there was a wobble but I kept it in for another five and then turned the oven off. I used the Lindt orange and almond 70per cent cocoa bar chopped up.
This brownie recipe is awesome. Used 200g of golden brown sugar.
It's so good.
Keep it in the fridge.
So good.Cooking time wasn’t long enough so having to put back in the oven!I am inspired to try this recipe. I am a novice baker. The instructions seem comprehensive and clear which has encouraged me. I am going to buy a 20cm x 20cm tin. If a buy a deep tin, will the deep sides detrimentally effect the bake? Should I be better off getting a shallower sided tin?. (I was reasoning that a deep tin might later come in useful for other bakes that require that depth, and thus I wouldn’t need to be buying another tin in the future).Hi, You could use a slightly deeper tin, I use a square cake tin to make mine, it's 7cm deep. I hope this helps.
LuluCan you make these with gluten free flour please? Just the normal plain flour from Sainsbury’s, not got rice flour or anything.....Hi,
We haven't tested this recipe with gluten free flour but we do have this recipe which is very good.
https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/gluten-free-brownies
LuluThis recipe is great, the brownies ALWAYS get so many complements. I do not believe the quantities need to be changed at all!
However, despite always following the instructions, cooking the mixture for 40-45min and brownies always coming out beautifully, the top of my brownie (the corners) always seem slightly burnt.. I got no fan oven so bake it on 180' I worry that if I was to reduce the temperature the brownie wouldn't cook as well. Is there any tips of how not to get the top burnt?Hi Marta,
I'm glad you like the recipe. Try covering the brownie in foil at the end to stop the corners burning.
LuluHi There I have been making this recipe through the lockdown and it's been amazing everytime but I'd like to make it in a bigger tin and I'm worried that altering the ingredients myself will ruin it.. I was basically going to try adding a quarter of the current measurements again and 1 extra egg for a tin that measures 23cm x 30cm. Could you tell me whether you think that would work please?Hi Bex,
You can scale up the recipe but that tin sounds quite a lot bigger, you may need more than a quarter of the mixture or your brownie might end up too thin.
LuluI liked the taste of this recipe a lot, but found it very heavy. Is there anyway I can make the brownies less filling?Hi,
We have lots of other brownie recipes if you don't like this one.
https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/brownie
LuluI love this recipe. After it cooked I Ieft the brownies in the oven so it can get a crisp top. I put in 200g light brown sugar because that was the only sugar I had and works fine. I also added 70g raspberries and it makes it so much betterFantastic! I cooked the brownie for 35 minutes, it definitely needed this amount of time. I also used white caster sugar as i didnt have golden. I also didnt have the right quantity of chocolate but even with less chocolate this recipe is Perfection! Even my mum (who hates chocolate puddings) loved the brownie! I served the brownie when it was still warm with some raspberry ripple ice cream- you must try this!Really nice brownies! I would definitely leave them in the oven for 10 extra minutes. I left them to cool/set for 2-4 hours and then put them in the fridge! Much nicer when you put them in the fridge!:)It is definitely worth watching the small video because it gives you a very useful tip with using the tin foil to lift the brownie out straight after cooking.I did another 15 mins at about 150° Fan (so 170° normal) and they’re perfectI absolutely love these brownies, my go-to recipe! I always use milk chocolate instead of dark as I prefer a lighter, creamier taste. I sometimes add chopped up biscuits or chocolate into the mix and on top for a fun twist!Once the actual baking is finished, leave it in the oven so that the crust can harden.
It is a very soft recipe but pays off really wellYum.
To make Christmassy I left the chopped chocolate out and replaced with heading for half a jar of mincemeat. Amazing
To make Christmassy I replaced the chopped chocolate with heading for half a jar of mincemeat. Amazing!I have replaced the white chocolate with caramel chocolate (Callebout Gold) and I grated half a tonka bean into the mix. I now believe in heaven.This recipe is fantastic and works every time for me. Must do points for me. Reduce sugar by 1/3. Far too much. Leave to cool in tin and then put in fridge overnight if you want it to set properly. Try making it and putting rum and raisin chocolate squares, white chocolate squares and good quality glace cherry halves in the middle. Then sprinkle pistachios over the top.

Vintage chocolate chip cookies,"An easy chocolate chip cookie recipe for soft biscuits with a squidgy middle that will impress family and friends. Make plenty as they're sure to be a hitRecipe TipFreezing the biscuitsIf you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/ 170 fan/ gas mark 5 and heat for 2 - 3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.Recipe TipStoring doughYou can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking.This is the best cookie recipe ever! I’ve made them multiple times, every time being perfect. I use light brown sugar and it works out fine. The only thing to keep in mind is it only makes 9-10 average sized cookies, as opposed to 30- but maybe I’m just greedy.These cookies were absolutely delicious! I used caster sugar instead of granular sugar because I didn't have any and substituted 100g of the plain chocolate for milk chocolate. They were soft, chocolaty and were just overall amazing. I saved some of the cookie dough in the fridge and I'm so excited to bake more!Really nice! A few things I would recommend doing. Make sure you refrigerate for at least an hour or they will make on thin sheet of cookie (not as nice as it sounds). Add about 1/4tsp baking powder as well which helps them rise a little (mine were still quite flat even though in the fride for 2 hours) Also, dont use salted butter as that will result in a very very salty cookie which overwhelms all the other flavours.Great cookie recipe. Always go down well. I add chocolate bars I have left instead of dark chocolate.I love this recipe! Super simple, had all the ingredients!! I used 100g choc chips instead, and they turned out really good. It was kind of hard to mix (at first) but I added a dash of milk, and it was easy!! Haven’t tried them but look great.So easy and delicious! I have added various smashed up chocolate bars to these as opposed to chocolate chips and they turned out really well!Makes a great batch of cookies every time!
I didn’t have light muscovado sugar on hand so used dark. It worked just as well and have the cookies a lovely, caramel colour.
I also used smarties and rainbow sprinkles instead of chocolate chips for a pop of colour. Happy baking!Delicious and really easy. Big hit with all the family. I used broken up Bournville and a bit of Dairy Milk instead of chocolate chips.Just used the 80g of soft brown sugar, which was sweet enough with the grated chocolate. End result - delicious!Seemed very thick so I added a splash of milk and of course they spread all over the baking tray...still, nice, light, crisp yet still chewy - yum :)Does anyone know how long these will stay good in an air tight container? Thanks in advance!Hi,
We advise 3 days but I have personally kept them for a week. You can freeze the dough and cook to order if you want. The tip under the recipe tells you how to do this.
LuluWill a cookie cutter with a design on it work on these cookies?Hi,
No I'm afraid it won't as they spread too much.
Luludoes it have to be salted butter? because other recipes have said to use unsalted.Hi,
You can use unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt to the dough instead. The salt brings out the other flavours.
LuluCould I use melted butter and use an all in one method if I was wanting to use this recipe for a cookie 'jar mix'?Hi Lauren,
Creaming the butter and sugar gives the cookies a particular texture. You can messagings around with cookie recipes in all sorts of ways, you still end up with nice cookies but the texture differs. So yes you could, but the cookies will be different. I'd beat the soft butter with the egg first and add it rather than melting the butter.
I hope this helps,
LuluI don't have any vanilla extract, and can't find it in the shops anywhere at the moment. Will the cookies still taste ok without?Hello,
Yes you can make these without the vanilla, they won't have quite as much flavour in the cookie dough but the chocolate chips should make up for that.
LuluI’ve made these cookies every weekend for the past 4weeks! They are incredible! I’ve recommended this recipe to all of my friends. At step 6 I put some flour on my hands and roll the dough into balls about the size of a golfball. I don’t flatten them. When they cook they flatten out. Sometimes at 4min cook time I also add pieces of chocolate to the top. Delicious!Take them out a little early. If they feel soft -REMEMBER- they really firm up. Many times, I have left them baking for too long.I made this recipe & the cookies turned out fantastic !! the perfect companion for a cuppa ! I changed it to make mint chocolate cookies, instead of vanilla extract I used peppermint extract & I just cut up some mint chocolate bars for the chocolate chips & they turned out spectacular!!So, the first time I baked these they turned out really spongy like cake. I tried them again today and they were significantly better. My advice is to do flour and butter as a 2:1 ratio. However much butter you use, the amount of flour is double that (ie 50g butter, 100g flour. ) I hope this tip helped, happy baking!To avoid the cookies from spreading out too much, place them in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. If the butter gets too warm they tend to spread out more.Used 50gr of sugar each (because reasons) and put them to bake as well spread out 3 cm diameter balls (13 cookies or so from the mixture). Very very delicious. They have a soft texture, they are not biscuits.I used just 160 g of demerara and it turned our fine.Use half the chocolate!Honestly the only recipe that's been so good I make an account just to leave a review for it. Been using this recipe as the basis for my cookies for a couple years now and they're honestly infamous in my friends circle now. If you're into the salt and chocolate combo, be liberal with the salt and use sea salt crystals for a little more depth. I use Tesco's own brand chocolate milk bars (since they taste amazing as is) for my chocolate and bake for 9 minutes at 200*C, melt-in-the-mouth gooey-ness, richness and depth :)Hi! I found this recipe brilliantly tasty and it was a hit with family! The second time I made them I wanted to change it up a bit so I added M&M’s and it worked absolutely perfect! I also made them thicker and turned the heat down to 160 degrees and had them in for 17 mins!",25,Easy,true
Apple sauce,"Our easy apple sauce is a great accompaniment to rich meats, such as goose or pork. It needs just three ingredients to make in one simple stepStarted going a bit brown when cooking so added a squeeze of lemon. Very tastyI put a cinnamon stick in with the apples while they're cooking, to add a subtle spicy flavour.So easy and tastyreally easy & tasty. popped in the freezer ready for christmas dinnerEasy and tasty. Freezes very well.Lovely and fresh! Used apples given to me and adjusted sugar to taste. I also used less butter as it doesn't really need that much (and wanted to make it a little lighter). Great recipe though!This is so much better than shop bought apple sauce which is too sweet for me. I can confirm it also freezes really well.Great simple recipe. I use any apples I have in fruit bowl and adjust the amount of sugar accordinglySimple but really tasty :-)Yummy and perfect for my Roast Pork on Christmas! I added the cinnamon and more sugar and it tastes gorgeous. Freezing it ready for the weekend.Can this be stored in jars and how long will it keep for?Thanks for your question. We'd suggest making and eating this recipe within a few days. Keep it covered in the fridge, pushing cling film down onto the surface to exclude air and prevent any discolouration. Give it a stir before serving.Hello great recipe, any idea how long it will keep once made, cheers hannah",30,Easy,false

Today I couldn't get filo pastry (small town supermarket) so tried it with puff pastry. Interesting, but still delicious!!Why did my sugar burn, it didn't turn into a liquid just a ball..followed the recipe. added a touch of water, now waterery mess.Delicious and so quick. I added some pine nuts too and used honey to cook the apples instead of sugar. Also cinnamon instead of nutmeg and allspice.very tasty and very easy,great for winter nights.had this yesterday - it was easy and gorgeous - Highly recommended!Very tasty, particularly when served warm with creme fresh.I made this last night and was so happy with it even if i left out the walnuts.
